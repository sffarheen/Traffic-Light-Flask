TRAFFIC LIGHT FLASK

Combining YOLO and RCNN offers a balanced approach to both speed and accuracy. YOLO provides real-time object detection capabilities, essential for fast-moving applications, while RCNN, known for its precision in region- based proposals, adds reliability in complex scenarios where traffic signs may be partially obstructed or surrounded by background noise.
This project successfully implements a hybrid traffic sign recognition system capable of real-time processing with high accuracy. The integration of YOLO and RCNN frameworks addresses many limitations of traditional methods. The system‚Äôs robustness in diverse conditions highlights its potential for deployment in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems.
 Specific challenges faced during the project include: 
‚Ä¢ Handling imbalanced datasets. 
‚Ä¢ Optimizing the model for varying environmental conditions.

FUTURE SCOPE:
YOLO is known for its speed and efficiency in object detection, making it suitable for real-time applications like traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. YOLO‚Äôs high processing speed ensures rapid identification, even on lower-power hardware, which is essential for automotive applications. In the future, we increased the performance of this process and be able to get more accuracy. Future enhancements may include expanding the dataset to cover more traffic sign variations.
