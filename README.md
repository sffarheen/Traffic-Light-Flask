# Traffic-Light-Flask
This project is a Flask-based web application that uses a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify traffic signs such as stop signs and traffic lights in a video stream. It highlights detections in real-time using OpenCV and optionally supports text-to-speech for detected signs.
